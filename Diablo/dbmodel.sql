-- dbmodel.sql

-- This is the file where you are describing the database schema of your game
-- Basically, you just have to export from PhpMyAdmin your table structure and copy/paste
-- this export here.
-- Note that the database itself and the standard tables ("global", "stats", "gamelog" and "player") are
-- already created and must not be created here

-- Note: The database schema is created from this file when the game starts. If you modify this file,
--       you have to restart a game to see your changes in database.

-- Example 1: create a standard "card" table to be used with the "Deck" tools (see example game "hearts"):

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `board` (
  board_x smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL,
  board_y smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL,

  board_player int(10) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,

  checker_id int(10) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,

  is_origin_selected boolean DEFAULT 0,

  PRIMARY KEY (board_x, board_y)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
